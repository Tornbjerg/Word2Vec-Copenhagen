# Public Transport Journey Pattern Analysis

This project analyses the public transport journey behvaiour patterns in Copenhagen using machine learning techniques to understand urban mobility patterns. The project processes and analyses journey data from Rejseplanen in a novel attempt at using an embedding model to describe behavioural data.

## Purpose
This project attempted at exploring the usage of commonly used word embedding models to analyse an abstract domain such as the public transportation using travel behaviour of individuals. Using data from Rejseplanen the usage of this approach showcased its novelty and potential usefullness in analysing the infrastructure of Copenhagen. If further analysis were to be made, with a more detailed and thougtful dataset, we are sure this approach could give new and interesting insights into the infrastructure of Copenhagen.

## Key Technologies & Libraries
- Python for data processing and analysis
- PyTorch for deep learning implementation
- Embedding models for journey pattern representation using Word2Vec
- Geographic data processing (geopy)
- Data visualization tools for journey pattern analysis

## Machine Learning Approach
The project implements a sophisticated embedding model to:
- Convert journey sequences into meaningful vector representations
- Analyze spatial and temporal patterns in public transport usage
- Identify clusters of similar journey patterns
- Visualize journey patterns in a reduced-dimensional space

## Data Processing
- Complex preprocessing pipeline handling multiple data sources
- Geographic coordinate mapping for Copenhagen stations
- Sequence generation from raw journey data
- Data cleaning and normalization for Copenhagen-specific journeys

## Note
Due to GDPR compliance, the actual journey data is not included in this repository. Likewise, are certain aspects of the original directory kept hidden. This repository serves the purpose of inspiration and giving a short insight into a fascinating project. For transparancies sake are otherwise *personal note*- files part of this repository without any cleanup - excuse the unstructured and messy notebooks.
